'A Charming Swiss Home That Respects, and Reimagines, the Past','THE ITALIAN WORD patinare is often invoked at Studio Peregalli, the Milanese interior design and architecture firm co-founded by Laura Sartori Rimini and Roberto Peregalli 27 years ago.

Virtually everything that makes it into one of Studio Peregalli’s spaces that’s not already an antique undergoes this process, creating a singular aesthetic that has attracted admirers such as the late French fashion executive Pierre Bergé (the former partner of Yves Saint Laurent), the husband-and-wife American artists John Currin and Rachel Feinstein and the German publisher and philanthropist Hubert Burda.',REAL

Throughout the property are artworks and design elements by local craftspeople, including gold-leaf trim done by a 106-year-old artisan and, in the hotel bistro, earthenware by a 16th-generation potter.

They’re slightly freaked out and hoping for tips to shore up their digital hygiene or for a guide that might help them navigate the internet without giving away their personal data. For months I’ve included a Tip of the Week feature for this very reason, but I’ve always felt conflicted about it, because the hard truth is that our data is leaking and trading all the time, in places we might not even know to look. Each privacy tip you follow is undoubtedly helpful (and you should follow them!), but it’s a bit like a single sandbag in a hurricane: You need to amass so, so many and be extremely vigilant to make a difference.',REAL

My hosts, from the now-defunct United States Information Agency, were determined to show me and the other Bulgarians in my group not only the American dream but also America’s underbelly. Before we could tour the city, we received instructions on how to comport ourselves in supposedly dangerous places. Our American hosts were clear that if we didn’t want to become victims, we shouldn’t behave like one.

'What’s on TV Thursday: ‘Gone Girl’ and a New Holiday Favorite','GONE GIRL (2014) 7:40 p.m. on FXM. Ben Affleck stars in this drama as Nick Dunne, a small-town Midwestern man who comes home one day to find his wife, Amy (Rosamund Pike), missing. Nick becomes a suspect in her disappearance, with the only evidence as to Amy’s whereabouts coming from her diary entries. These detail the deterioration of her marriage and her fear of her husband. And while Nick maintains his innocence, it becomes clear that Amy may not be a reliable narrator. Based on the 2012 novel by Gillian Flynn, who also wrote the screenplay, “Gone Girl” is “a ghastly vision,” Manohla Dargis wrote in her New York Times review. Dargis added that the director, David Fincher, “fashions an ever more haunted, haunting world that wavers so violently between ordinariness and aberration that, as in his other movies, the two soon blur.”',REAL

'Stop Investing in China’s Brutality','Last month, the United States government issued sanctions against eight Chinese companies for complicity in the crackdown on Chinese Muslims in Xinjiang. As many as a million Uighurs, Kazakhs and other ethnic minorities have been “interned” — wrenched away from families and dumped into harsh detention camps that the government insists are merely re-education centers. In light of those sanctions, why haven’t the California State Teachers’ Retirement System and other American funds announced that they would stop investing in  companies under sanctions? And why is the federal employee retirement fund poised to move retirement assets to an index fund that includes Chinese companies in 2020?',REAL
'11 New Books We Recommend This Week','Religiously speaking, I’m something of a Christian mutt — the grandson of a Congregational minister, I was raised Presbyterian and educated at an Episcopal high school before converting to Catholicism almost a decade ago. (Before I did, I told a Jesuit friend that I had doubts. “Who doesn’t?” he said.) So the spiritually minded books on this week’s list hold particular interest for me. There’s Karen Armstrong’s “The Lost Art of Scripture,” which argues for a literary view of sacred texts, and Jack Miles’s “Religion as We Know It,” a history of belief and its place in culture. There’s Melvin Konner’s “Believers,” which looks for scientific and psychological explanations for the persistence of faith, and, less overtly but no less appealingly, the questing and philosophical poems in Charles Wright’s “Oblivion Banjo.” Any of those might do nicely to set the mood this week, as readers of various faiths and denominations hurtle toward their high holidays.',REAL

Her dowdier wife, Edith Evans-Whinery, leans toward her in affection and probably exhaustion; she’s clearly the homemaker in this homesteading family in Pie Town, N.M., circa 1940.

Over the years, I’ve accumulated a stack of madeleine pans; the original plaque shares cupboard space with nonstick, silicone and mini-madeleine pans too. They’ve all seen plenty of use, but never more than recently: Since September, when I met Cédric Grolet, I’ve made, I think, at least 200 of the little teacakes.

The flower’s developer, Alice, explains to her colleagues at Plantworks — a company preparing new products for an upcoming market fair — that this special plant needs special care. One must not just water it, but talk to it. In return, its pollen will release a potent antidepressant. The flower will literally make you happy.',REAL

'What’s on TV Thursday: ‘Gone Girl’ and a New Holiday Favorite','GONE GIRL (2014) 7:40 p.m. on FXM. Ben Affleck stars in this drama as Nick Dunne, a small-town Midwestern man who comes home one day to find his wife, Amy (Rosamund Pike), missing. Nick becomes a suspect in her disappearance, with the only evidence as to Amy’s whereabouts coming from her diary entries. These detail the deterioration of her marriage and her fear of her husband. And while Nick maintains his innocence, it becomes clear that Amy may not be a reliable narrator. Based on the 2012 novel by Gillian Flynn, who also wrote the screenplay, “Gone Girl” is “a ghastly vision,” Manohla Dargis wrote in her New York Times review. Dargis added that the director, David Fincher, “fashions an ever more haunted, haunting world that wavers so violently between ordinariness and aberration that, as in his other movies, the two soon blur.”',REAL

'Stop Investing in China’s Brutality','Last month, the United States government issued sanctions against eight Chinese companies for complicity in the crackdown on Chinese Muslims in Xinjiang. As many as a million Uighurs, Kazakhs and other ethnic minorities have been “interned” — wrenched away from families and dumped into harsh detention camps that the government insists are merely re-education centers. In light of those sanctions, why haven’t the California State Teachers’ Retirement System and other American funds announced that they would stop investing in  companies under sanctions? And why is the federal employee retirement fund poised to move retirement assets to an index fund that includes Chinese companies in 2020?',REAL

Over the years, I’ve accumulated a stack of madeleine pans; the original plaque shares cupboard space with nonstick, silicone and mini-madeleine pans too. They’ve all seen plenty of use, but never more than recently: Since September, when I met Cédric Grolet, I’ve made, I think, at least 200 of the little teacakes. Come for dinner, and the odds are good that the last morsel I’ll serve you will be a madeleine. A perfect madeleine.',REAL

'Have We Finally Caught Up With Andrea Fraser?','IT WAS NEARLY closing time at the museum: Long shadows had already devoured most of downtown Los Angeles and the hangar-like space was hushed. Andrea Fraser stood before a small TV watching “Official Welcome,” one of her landmark performances. Onscreen, she appeared in a tasteful black dress at the opening of her 2003 exhibition in Hamburg, Germany, making remarks from a lectern. She thanked the curators who had made her retrospective possible; she thanked her mother, who had flown all the way from California for the event. The crowd clapped on cue. But then the woman went rogue, as though a computer virus had infected her gracious-artist software. “Thank you, Andrea,” she boomed in a deep male voice, morphing into the first of more than a dozen art-world personae who take over the speech — a piratical dealer, a fawning patron, an artist best known for pickling a shark. Before it’s over, she has shed her dress and then her Gucci bra, thong and stilettos to address the audience fully nude. “It takes a lot of courage to do what she does,” she said, assuming the voice of an approving critic. “She goes far beyond where most artists have the intelligence or audacity to operate.” The 30-minute piece — funny, brash and often excruciating — ends after the woman, back in her dress but somehow more exposed than ever, breaks down in sobs.',REAL

Here, Ivy Tsang, Jonathan Chu, and their chef and partner, Michael Jong Lim, serve à la carte and tasting menus that amount to a tour of the Japanese table. Tempura, yakitori, karaage, udon and chawanmushi are all there, along with some luxury specialties like wok lobster and uni risotto. The sommelier, Fred Dexheimer, has assembled the sake portfolio. The minimalist 38-seat dining room has a two-fold mission. Kappo dinners are its nighttime feature, and a wooden partition will close off the casual Chikarashi portion of the space with its soapstone counter, leaving just the intimate restaurant.

'Have We Finally Caught Up With Andrea Fraser?','IT WAS NEARLY closing time at the museum: Long shadows had already devoured most of downtown Los Angeles and the hangar-like space was hushed. Andrea Fraser stood before a small TV watching “Official Welcome,” one of her landmark performances. Onscreen, she appeared in a tasteful black dress at the opening of her 2003 exhibition in Hamburg, Germany, making remarks from a lectern. She thanked the curators who had made her retrospective possible; she thanked her mother, who had flown all the way from California for the event. The crowd clapped on cue. But then the woman went rogue, as though a computer virus had infected her gracious-artist software. “Thank you, Andrea,” she boomed in a deep male voice, morphing into the first of more than a dozen art-world personae who take over the speech — a piratical dealer, a fawning patron, an artist best known for pickling a shark. Before it’s over, she has shed her dress and then her Gucci bra, thong and stilettos to address the audience fully nude. “It takes a lot of courage to do what she does,” she said, assuming the voice of an approving critic. “She goes far beyond where most artists have the intelligence or audacity to operate.” The 30-minute piece — funny, brash and often excruciating — ends after the woman, back in her dress but somehow more exposed than ever, breaks down in sobs.',REAL
